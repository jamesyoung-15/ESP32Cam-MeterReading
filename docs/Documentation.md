# Documentation for ESP32-Camera Water Meter Reading Project

## Requirements
### Hardware
For hardware, you only need an ESP32-CAM module and a way to upload code to it (recommend ESP32-CAM-MB but a USB to TTL should also work). There is no need for SD card as this project uses the onboard SPIFFS filesystem for storing recent camera pictures to display to web.

### Software
For ESP32-CAM code, use either PlatformIO or Arduino IDE. If using Arduino IDE make sure to download necessary libraries. On the cloud side, make sure to have an AWS account (be wary without free tier this will cost money).
